   title "Anisotropic diffusion coefficient using champ_fonc_xyz"
   description "In this 2D test case, the directions of the anisotropic diffusivity coefficient are parallel to X and Y axes. This diffusion coefficient is constant in all the domain. Its value is 100 along the X axis and 1 along the Y axis. We can represent it by the following matrix \latex_($$ \left( \begin{matrix} 100 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right) $$\latex_) A thermal conduction problem is then solved using this anisotropic diffusion coefficient."
