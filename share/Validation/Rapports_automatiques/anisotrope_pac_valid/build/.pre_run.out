Solving Conduction equation :

Option Petsc: -mat_mumps_icntl_14 35 not taken cause -mat_mumps_icntl_14 already defined to 35
The LU decomposition of a matrix with Cholesky from MUMPS may take several minutes, please wait...
If the decomposition fails/crashes cause a lack of memory, then increase the number of CPUs for your calculation
or use Cholesky_out_of_core keyword to write the decomposition on the disk, thus saving memory but with an extra CPU cost during solve.
To see the RAM required by the decomposition in the .out file, add impr option to the solver: petsc cholesky { impr }
If an error INFOG(1)=-8|-9|-17|-20 is returned, you can try to increase the ICNTL(14) parameter of MUMPS by using the -mat_mumps_icntl_14 command line option.
